The purpose of religion is to achieve the goals of salvation for oneself and others. With pursuing that common goal, many religions have created communities that span the globe, representing their respective faiths in the search for something much larger than themselves. However, despite that, religions have also stemmed fear, hatred, and division between the many different religious communities. Religious intolerance is responsible for a lot of mass killings and atrocities that have taken place in countries like Syria, Nigeria, India, and Pakistan. The Sanctum is a way to explore the beliefs and artifacts of religions from around the globe, by experiencing its' place of worship without any preconceived notions or prejudice. Allow yourself to see these holy places, as they were meant to be seen, and as they are seen by followers of that religion.
