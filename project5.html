          <p class="text"> Ecoprint is a speculative app designed to influence human activities that
            cause climate change. Each human action is tracked by the application in
            order to create a carbon footprint value for the user. Higher the value,
            greater the ecological damage being done. By giving the user a fixed set
            of carbon footprint points that they can spend, the application aims to
            limit environmental damage caused by human activities.

      <p class="text">This app was conceptualized to ensure the survival of the planet in 2050.
        During this time, it can be assumed that carbon dioxide levels in the
        atmosphere would have reached intolerable heights. Lives would be at
        stake if human actions cannot be restricted. By law, every government
         mandates the citizens of their country to have app, giving each user an
          ecological footprint Id. The app then tracks the user activity and creates
           an ecological footprint value. This value is reflection of user lifestyle.

        Children under the age of 16 don't have accounts and thus are considered dependents of their parents. Their carbon spending
        would be divided between the parents. </p>

      <p class="sign-heading"> PROGRESS | HOME </p>
      <div class="eco-images"><img src="images/ecoprog.png" height="100%" width="100%"></a> </div>
      <p class="text">The home screen displays a progress chart and navigation to the core
         features of the app. This chart is a representation of the users lifestyle
          and carbon credit usage on daily, weekly and monthly basis. If the user
           were to click the circular progress chart they would be taken the
           screen on the left to view its complete break down. Within the chart,
           the numeric + alphabetical value is the users carbon footprint value.
        The screen on the right shows nations that have the lowest average carbon footprint among users. The government of every country must aim to have low average carbon footprints to be ranked high on the 'World Leads page.'</p>
      <br>

      <p class="sign-heading"> CORE FEATURE: SCAN </p>
      <div class="eco-images"><img src="images/ecoscan.png" height="100%" width="100%"></a> </div>
      <p class="text"> The user is able to scan any purchasable object and see the carbon credits used to manufacture and distribute that item. The carbon score of the item is the same the amount of carbon credits that would be deducted from the
        users account. </p>

      <br>
      <p class="sign-heading"> CORE FEATURE: ECOBANK </p>
      <div class="eco-images"><img src="images/ecobank.png" height="100%" width="100%"></a> </div>
      <p class="text">A space where the user can loan carbon credits if they run out of their monthly budget, have an emergency or want to work on a project. In due time, they have to repay their debt, just like that of an actual bank.</p>

      <br>
      <p class="sign-heading"> CORE FEATURE: CALCULATOR </p>
      <div class="eco-images"><img src="images/ecocalc.png" height="100%" width="100%"></a> </div>
      <p class="text">The calculator helps users create possible scenarios such as 'a trip to the mall' or a 'vacation' to find out the possible carbon credits that the event would cost them.</p>

      <br>
      <p class="sign-heading"> CORE FEATURE: BROWSE </p>
      <div class="eco-images"><img src="images/ecobrowse.png" height="100%" width="100%"></a> </div>
      <p class="text">Users can browse through a catalog of products and services that are new in the market in terms of their carbon footprint value.</p>


      <br>
      <p class="sign-heading"> IMPACT </p>
      <br>
      <p class="text">Since this app is meant to be mandatory for all citizens, it would
        hopefully result in the betterment of the environment. People would learn to be more environmentally conscious and for once put the
        planet before their own needs.</p>

      <br>
      <p class="sign-heading"> EXTENDED IMPLICATIONS </p>
      <br>
      <p class="text"><u><i>Excessive Expenditure</i></u>
        Users maybe driven to purchase multiple products or services just
         because they have low carbon footprint values, indirectly increasing their
          carbon footprint value. They might unintentionally spend a lot carbon
           credits as opposed to simply purchasing one item with a high carbon footprint value. (Similar to how consumer behavior works when there
           is a sale)</p>

      <br>
      <p class="text"><u><i>Cyber Crime</i></u>
        With technology controlling credit distribution, there would be an inadvertent rise in cyber crime, such as hacking in order to gain carbon credit points. This would result in geological as well political unrest among countries. </p>

      <br>
      <p class="text"><u><i>Social Divide</i></u>
        Since the footprint value works on a ranking scale, (A,B,C,D) it may cause a social divide and a new form of cast system among people.</p>
